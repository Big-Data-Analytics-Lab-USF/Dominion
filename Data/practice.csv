I would trip over my own feet in the rush. Any of the powerful, popular Democrats? Probably, though I would hate to do it - I really don't like the man. He just happens to understand, better than any Democrat on the Hill (including Biden) what our country needs, and it isn't more socialism, it isn't more illegal aliens, it isn't more supporting the world and it isn't more freebies from Uncle Sam.

At his age, with his wealth, and plenty of younger people to carry the torch (even his own children) IÉ??d think heÉ??d be a fool to even entertain the idea. He may be narcissistic but that would just be insane! Since when did America decide the only people qualified to be president have to be candidates for geriatric care! Really, if the only way to get a young president is for a senile president to pick a young VP this country needs to start over! reply report 91 Ken Burgess posted 2 months ago in reply to this No. I am not saddened by the end of the Trump Administration. I am disheartened that a such a stooge for the very worst that DC has to offer the American people is transplanting him. This incoming Administration, along with a Congress controlled by Pelosi and Schumer are going to be ruthless on the American people. And as if on cue, there is this headline: ""AOC Calls For Listing Trump Supporters For Future"" reply report 93 GA Anderson posted 2 months ago in reply to this Ha! I agree with you. I would not vote for Trump in 2024. regardless of who is opponent is. I vote for a candidate, not against one. Unfortunately, for me, I was not able to cast a valid presidential vote in this election. I could not vote for Pres. Trump and I could not vote for the Biden/Harris ticket, so I voted my down-ballot selections. I actually sat at the ballot marking table for at least a full 15 minutes trying to convince myself to vote for Pres. Trump because I do like his policy achievements and the angst he has brought to the 'business as usual' politicians of DC, but I couldn't do it. So I didn't vote for a presidential choice. And I feel pissed that I didn't have that choice because of what my options were. Relative to your Pelosi/Schumer thought I think both will have a struggle holding onto their current positions. As many pundits are saying, I think the 2020 election results are going to re-align the Democrat party, with the AOC and Squad factions losing power. From my lips to God's ear. GA reply report 91 Ken Burgess posted 2 months ago in reply to this I believe this was about more than DC politics getting back to normal. This was about resuming the path the nation and the world had been on prior to Trump and Brexit and a few smaller EU nations going Nationalistic. Trump was the major Domino that had to fall, now Biden will facilitate Agenda 2030, the Global Compact for Migration, the Paris Accord, etc. and the concept of America as a Nation, as an independent, sovereign, unique entity that inspired the world and led it for the last 75 years will be over with. A very different world is being born, one that is hard to discern because we are living in this particular moment, technology is transforming our world, there is no place for individualism or independence in the new world coming into existence... there will be Social Credit, Digital Wallets, 24/7 monitorization, and AI making things like driving obsolete. This also solidifies China's ascension as global leader and America stepping back from center stage. Biden and the rest in DC will go right back to being sycophants. reply report 86 gmwilliams posted 2 months ago in reply to this Exactly, Biden is nothing but a career politician. Trump was an outsider & on that basis, Trump was a threat to both powers that be. Both parties were threatened by Trump. Trump was his own person & was never a brownnoser. He cared about America & her people. Biden just want to be a politician. People voted for Biden to get back at Trump- that's all. reply report 97 FatFreddysCat posted 2 months ago Good Lord, no. reply report 77 Live to Learn posted 2 months ago Hard to say. Who's he running against? What is their platform? How well had the country done under Biden? How well have I done under Biden? Anyone who said yay or nay at this point probably shouldn't be voting, since personality is all you care about in a president. reply report 82 Rodric29 posted 8 weeks ago No, I would not vote for him. I voted for him this time and he is showing me that I voted for someone who is not a true Republican or a Conservative by his actions. What do I expect, though. My original assessment of him was he is a joke. I should have stuck with that one. reply report 61 abwilliams posted 8 weeks ago So we should just ignore the multiple inconsistencies in multiple counties or the hundreds of notarized sworn affidavits from poll workers/spotters or the fact that Dominion Voting, Inc. is in hiding, refusing to answer questions and just accept this as a not so fair-not so square...loss? Why should Republicans fight this fight right? We always take the high road! It's the Dems that do things like spend 4 years telling us that our President is illegitimate.... If you see his questioning this, the Republicans (who aren't appeasing hand-wringers) questioning this ""as a joke"", then you see half of your fellow countrymen as a joke. All those who believe in the integrity of elections(every citizen should care) We MUST get to the bottom of this....or we will never be able to trust a single election again, in this Country. reply report 83 PrettyPanther posted 8 weeks ago in reply to this As I have said from the beginning, let him prove it. That's not working out so well for him so far. While I might roll my eyes at the massive waste of time and money bringing over two dozen cases to court, almost all of which have already been dismissed or ruled against, he has a right to his challenges as long has he is doing so legally and ethically. I hope you and other fraud believers have donated as much of your life savings as you can spare to his election fraud fund, as this is an expensive endeavor and I have no doubt you and others consider it vital to our democracy. reply report 91 Stevennix2001 posted 8 weeks ago in reply to this Well regardless of what happens, I can only see this dividing our country more. If Trump pulls a miracle out of his ass, and somehow gets the election results overturned in court, then your going to have a lot of people on the left saying how the Republicans stole the election this year. But if things continue as they are and Biden becomes our president as it seems like a forgone conclusion that he will be then people on the right and his supporters will say Biden rigged the election. While I do think the numbers for the election does seem suspicious to be honest, the reality is even if there was fraud then the problem is proving it. That's on trump to prove as all we can do as American citizens is try to survive during these harsh times regardless of who's in office. I just hope this doesn't lead to a civil war as that's the thing that worries me honestly. reply report 83 PrettyPanther posted 8 weeks ago in reply to this I live in Trump country where right wingers perpetually boast on social media about taking up arms to take back their country.

Llyod George had supported the 2nd and 3rd home rule bills, voting with Tim Healy. He introduced the rubbishy 4th home rule bill in 1920 that was rubbishy because he relied on conservative MPs to stay in power. Had we talked, and waited for a labour government, partition would not have been such a bitter event. Or so it seems to me now. Finland voted for independence in 1917 and the mandate of the Finnish Nation was respected and Finland was granted independence by the Soviet Union at the stroke of a pen in 1918. Period. Ireland voted for independence in 1918 and the mandate of the Irish Nation was rejected out of hand by Britain. Period. Spot the difference yet ?

America (North and South) North America: 1. Canada - Britain, France - mid 16th century to Confederation (1867) or the Canada Act (1982). After the Canada Act, all the constitutional control was turned over to Canada by the UK. 2. USA - Britain, France, Spain, Dutch, Germany - mid 16th century to American Independence (1776). Russians had colonized the Alaska region until the US purchased it. South America: 1. Brazil - Portuguese - roughly 300 years from 1500 to 1815. The Dutch and French also asserted their rule in Brazil for short periods. 2. Argentina - Spain - 16th century to Argentine Independence (1816). All the countries were colonized at some point in time by most of the European countries (UK, France, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, É??) American continent ( north) was colonized by all- USA was colonized by Italy/ German/ French/ English. Mexico, entire central America, entire South America [ except Brazil , Guyana] were colonized by Spain. Brazil was Portuguese colony, Guyana was colonized by England, France and Dutch! The Caribbean islands were colonized by England/ Spain/ Dutch. Africa All the countries were colonized at some point in time by most of the European countries (UK, France, Belgium, Germany, É??) Ethiopia was technically an Italian colony between 1936 and 1941, when they were delivered by the British and recovered their monarchy. So, they are in the colony list, even if it was only 5 years. All of Africa except Ethiopia and Liberia was colonized by every European colonial power possible. 50 + nations in Africa- colonized by Portuguese/ Germany/ France/ England/ Holland/ Spain/ even by Italy for short time. ( South Africa was initially a Dutch colony). Oceania All the countries were colonized at some point in time by most of the European countries (do you start to see a pattern? J ) except one: Tonga Tonga was the only Pacific nation to retain its monarchical government (still in place). They became a British protectorate in 1900 but remained sovereign. Asia Almost all the countries were colonized by European, countries or japan or China, except 5 countries: China, only partially occupied by Japan during WWII and forced to sign É??unequal treatyÉ?ù in favor of the European during the Qing dynasty Japan, only briefly occupied by the USA after WWII Bhutan, they lost two war against Britain and had to give some territories but remained independent Nepal, they also lost a war against Britain but became after a strong ally of Britain and remained independent Thailand, the only south-Asian country to remain independent thanks to good leaders that used the rivalry between French and British to be accepted as a buffer state between both colonial power (in the process, they also lost lot of territories) 1. India - Britain, Portuguese, Dutch, French - 17th century to Indian Independence (1947). The French, the Portuguese and the Dutch held islands and major ports in the Indian subcontinent. The Portuguese left India in 1961. 2. Korea - Japan - Around 1910 to 1945. 3. Hong Kong - Britain - 1842 to 1997. Except for Japanese occupation from 1941 to 1945. 4. Burma (Myanmar) - Britain - 1824 to 1948. Whole Asia - with couple of exception- was colonized. India ( no Pakistan at that time nor Bangla Desh), Ceylon, Malaya, Singapore, Maldives etc. Kuwait/ UAE etc were protectorates. Giant Indonesia was under Dutch, Philippines was under Spain/ USA/ Japan. Vietnam/ Laos/ Cambodia were under France. Middle-east Again, except three countries (Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey), they were all colonized by European: Iran. The country was invaded by Britain and the soviet during WWII. The Shah was neutral but pro-axis. The problem is that with Barbarossa, the trans-Iranian railways was vital to send resources to the soviets (for the lend-lease) . Therefore, Britain and the Soviet Union invaded Iran in 1941, put a new pro-ally Shah and kept control of the country until 1946. However, the country was just occupied and not a colony per se. Saudi Arabia. Nobody even bothered to colonize these deserts. And when the petrol was found in 1938, colonization was not trendy anymore 1. Egypt - Britain - 1882 to 1914. 2. Algeria - France - 1830 to 1962 3. Palestine - UK - 1920 to 1948 Now mostly Israel, Palestine was more of a British occupation than a colony. Europe Here, itÉ??s sometimes a bit tricky, e.g. if you go back in time the south of Italy was a Greek colony, so Italy should be a colonized country É?? However, at these time the concept of country was really different, so I will only take into account modern history, when the state-nation appeared, i.e. when the concept of nation that we use appeared, so after the French revolution. I also consider a country as a colony if there is a will to É??replaceÉ?ù the population. E.g. Lithuania was a Russian colony as Russia wanted to implant lot of Russian there. On the other hand, Belgium was not a Dutch colony, as the Dutch only wanted to annex the country. Then almost all the countries of western Europe were not colony (but most of them where conquered at some point), except Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland and Finland: Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. The three Baltic states were Russian colony, with a forced implantation of Russian people. Finland is a more dubious case. It was also a Russian colony, although they were relatively free, so they could be considered more as a protectorate. Poland, it was split between Russia, Austria and Germany and all of them wanted to implant people there. However, some other countries could be considered as colony of other. I personally donÉ??t as in these cases, there was no will to replace the population and harvest all the resources. It was more a É??usual occupationÉ?ù, were one country annex the other. A good example is Belgium that was occupied by the Spanish, Austrian, French and Dutch over times but they were each time considered as part of the country and not a colony. There was no will to replace the Belgian by Spanish people or to send back all the resources to Austria. There was also a will to invest there. However, other people may disagree with me. Amongst these countries, we have: Ukraine. Again, it was conquered by Russian but I donÉ??t know if we can consider it as a colony. The Russian only wanted to annex the É??white RussianÉ?ù Balkan states + Greek, itÉ??s a total mess between the Austria and Ottoman occupation and the war between the Balkan countries. However, I donÉ??t think that they fall under the colony status. The former states of the Austrian empire. Again, was the Czech Republic an Austrian colony. I donÉ??t think so, but other may have another point of view Greenland, Faeroe Island, and all the island under the control of Denmark, Norway, É?? Again are they protectorate or colony, is mater at discussion. South Pacific: 1. Australia - Britain, Dutch - 18th century to 1901. 2. New Zealand - Britain - 1847 to self-governing (1853) or dominion (1907). Australia/ NZ/ Fiji were under UK ( even now). Pacific islands were under England/ France/ USA ( even now Samoa is under USA). - Alaska, Angola, Australia, Barbados, Brazil, Canada, Congo, Ghana, Greenland, Guinea-Bissau, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Liberia, South Africa, Macau, Malta, Mozambique, Philippines, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, United States of America. Which countries/regions are colonized even today Instead of É??coloniesÉ??, these are more like autonomous territories without sovereignty Under Denmark: Faroe Islands, Greenland Under Finland: Aland Islands Under France: Saint Barthelemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Wallis and Futuna, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Clipperton Island, French Southern and Antarctic Lands (consists: Reunion, Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, Mayotte) Under Netherlands: Aruba, Curacao, Sint Maarten Under Norway: Svalbard, Jan Mayen. There are some under USA and UK as well, but I canÉ??t seem to find a proper list of them, so IÉ??ll update the answer with them later. Palestine deserves a special mention for being colonised and under occupation by the British from 1920, and 1948 to present by Jewish settlers. While other nations allow the colonized population equal/voting rights to vote, Israel doesnÉ??t have the population to support such an approach and, therefore, prolongs the occupation/apartheid indefinitely to ensure Jewish majority in government in apartheid democracy.",unknown,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,0,,,,http://www.youtube.com/all_comments?v=FoqTxcieUQo&lc=UgyNmUfcUZhcIKcNrrB4AaABAg.9Exci9wpJQy9FbHYnufPk_,,,5151e08bb4b6cb098290c41ce33496b9,,FALSE,,,,,reply,0,,1.00E+11,,,0,0,0,,,0,,0,FALSE,2023-03-02T14:47:35.360+0000,,,,,,,youtube,YouTube,,,FALSE,,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,0,,YouTube,,,VCOMMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Vlad Igor,,,,,,,,,

Because it's that good. And because I need an antidote to what I wrote earlier, when I was so depressed about what is happening in our country now: March 15, 1965 [As delivered in person before a joint session at 9:02 p.m.] Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the Congress: I speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy. I urge every member of both parties, Americans of all religions and of all colors, from every section of this country, to join me in that cause. At times history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in man's unending search for freedom. So it was at Lexington and Concord. So it was a century ago at Appomattox. So it was last week in Selma, Alabama. There, long-suffering men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as Americans. Many were brutally assaulted. One good man, a man of God, was killed. There is no cause for pride in what has happened in Selma. There is no cause for self-satisfaction in the long denial of equal rights of millions of Americans. But there is cause for hope and for faith in our democracy in what is happening here tonight. For the cries of pain and the hymns and protests of oppressed people have summoned into convocation all the majesty of this great Government--the Government of the greatest Nation on earth. Our mission is at once the oldest and the most basic of this country: to right wrong, to do justice, to serve man. In our time we have come to live with moments of great crisis. Our lives have been marked with debate about great issues; issues of war and peace, issues of prosperity and depression. But rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of America itself. Rarely are we met with a challenge, not to our growth or abundance, our welfare or our security, but rather to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved Nation. The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue. And should we defeat every enemy, should we double our wealth and conquer the stars, and still be unequal to this issue, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation. For with a country as with a person, ""What is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul ?"" There is no Negro problem. There is no Southern problem. There is no Northern problem. There is only an American problem. And we are met here tonight as Americans--not as Democrats or Republicans-we are met here as Americans to solve that problem. This was the first nation in the history of the world to be founded with a purpose. The great phrases of that purpose still sound in every American heart, North and South: ""All men are created equal""--""government by consent of the governed""--""give me liberty or give me death."" Well, those are not just clever words, or those are not just empty theories. In their name Americans have fought and died for two centuries, and tonight around the world they stand there as guardians of our liberty, risking their lives. Those words are a promise to every citizen that he shall share in the dignity of man. This dignity cannot be found in a man's possessions; it cannot be found in his power, or in his position. It really rests on his right to be treated as a man equal in opportunity to all others. It says that he shall share in freedom, he shall choose his leaders, educate his children, and provide for his family according to his ability and his merits as a human being. To apply any other test--to deny a man his hopes because of his color or race, his religion or the place of his birth--is not only to do injustice, it is to deny America and to dishonor the dead who gave their lives for American freedom. THE RIGHT TO VOTE Our fathers believed that if this noble view of the rights of man was to flourish, it must be rooted in democracy. The most basic right of all was the right to choose your own leaders. The history of this country, in large measure, is the history of the expansion of that right to all of our people. Many of the issues of civil rights are very complex and most difficult. But about this there can and should be no argument. Every American citizen must have an equal right to vote. There is no reason which can excuse the denial of that right. There is no duty which weighs more heavily on us than the duty we have to ensure that right. Yet the harsh fact is that in many places in this country men and women are kept from voting simply because they are Negroes. Every device of which human ingenuity is capable has been used to deny this right. The Negro citizen may go to register only to be told that the day is wrong, or the hour is late, or the official in charge is absent. And if he persists, and if he manages to present himself to the registrar, he may be disqualified because he did not spell out his middle name or because he abbreviated a word on the application. And if he manages to fill out an application he is given a test. The registrar is the sole judge of whether he passes this test. He may be asked to recite the entire Constitution, or explain the most complex provisions of State law. And even a college degree cannot be used to prove that he can read and write. For the fact is that the only way to pass these barriers is to show a white skin. Experience has clearly shown that the existing process of law cannot overcome systematic and ingenious discrimination. No law that we now have on the books-and I have helped to put three of them there--can ensure the right to vote when local officials are determined to deny it. In such a case our duty must be clear to all of us. The Constitution says that no person shall be kept from voting because of his race or his color. We have all sworn an oath before God to support and to defend that Constitution. We must now act in obedience to that oath. GUARANTEEING THE RIGHT TO VOTE Wednesday I will send to Congress a law designed to eliminate illegal barriers to the right to vote. The broad principles of that bill will be in the hands of the Democratic and Republican leaders tomorrow. After they have reviewed it, it will come here formally as a bill. I am grateful for this opportunity to come here tonight at the invitation of the leadership to reason with my friends, to give them my views, and to visit with my former colleagues. I have had prepared a more comprehensive analysis of the legislation which I had intended to transmit to the clerk tomorrow but which I will submit to the clerks tonight. But I want to really discuss with you now briefly the main proposals of this legislation, This bill will strike down restrictions to voting in all elections--Federal, State, and local--which have been used to deny Negroes the right to vote. This bill will establish a simple, uniform standard which cannot be used, however ingenious the effort, to flout our Constitution. It will provide for citizens to be registered by officials of the United States Government if the State officials refuse to register them. It will eliminate tedious, unnecessary lawsuits which delay the right to vote. Finally, this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting. I will welcome the suggestions from all of the Members of Congress--I have no doubt that I will get some--on ways and means to strengthen this law and to make it effective. But experience has plainly shown that this is the only path to carry out the command of the Constitution. To those who seek to avoid action by their National Government in their own communities; who want to and who seek to maintain purely local control over elections, the answer is simple: Open your polling places to all your people. Allow men and women to register and vote whatever the color of their skin. Extend the rights of citizenship to every citizen of this land. THE NEED FOR ACTION There is no constitutional issue here. The command of the Constitution is plain. There is no moral issue. It is wrong--deadly wrong--to deny any of your fellow Americans the right to vote in this country. There is no issue of States rights or national rights. There is only the struggle for human rights. I have not the slightest doubt what will be your answer. The last time a President sent a civil rights bill to the Congress it contained a provision to protect voting rights in Federal elections. That civil rights bill was passed after 8 long months of debate. And when that bill came to my desk from the Congress for my signature, the heart of the voting provision had been eliminated. This time, on this issue, there must be no delay, no hesitation and no compromise with our purpose. We cannot, we must not, refuse to protect the right of every American to vote in every election that he may desire to participate in. And we ought not and we cannot and we must not wait another 8 months before we get a bill. We have already waited a hundred years and more, and the time for waiting is gone. So I ask you to join me in working long hours--nights and weekends, if necessary--to pass this bill. And I don't make that request lightly. For from the window where I sit with the problems of our country I recognize that outside this chamber is the outraged conscience of a nation, the grave concern of many nations, and the harsh judgment of history on our acts. WE SHALL OVERCOME But even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over. What happened in Selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and State of America. It is the effort of American Negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of American life. Their cause must be our cause too. Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we shall overcome. As a man whose roots go deeply into Southern soil I know how agonizing racial feelings are. I know how difficult it is to reshape the attitudes and the structure of our society. But a century has passed, more than a hundred years, since the Negro was freed. And he is not fully free tonight. It was more than a hundred years ago that Abraham Lincoln, a great President of another party, signed the Emancipation Proclamation, but emancipation is a proclamation and not a fact. A century has passed, more than a hundred years, since equality was promised. And yet the Negro is not equal. A century has passed since the day of promise. And the promise is unkept. The time of justice has now come. I tell you that I believe sincerely that no force can hold it back. It is right in the eyes of man and God that it should come. And when it does, I think that day will brighten the lives of every American. For Negroes are not the only victims. How many white children have gone uneducated, how many white families have lived in stark poverty, how many white lives have been scarred by fear, because we have wasted our energy and our substance to maintain the barriers of hatred and terror? So I say to all of you here, and to all in the Nation tonight, that those who appeal to you to hold on to the past do so at the cost of denying you your future. This great, rich, restless country can offer opportunity and education and hope to all: black and white, North and South, sharecropper and city dweller. These are the enemies: poverty, ignorance, disease. They are the enemies and not our fellow man, not our neighbor. And these enemies too, poverty, disease and ignorance, we shall overcome. AN AMERICAN PROBLEM Now let none of us in any sections look with prideful righteousness on the troubles in another section, or on the problems of our neighbors. There is really no part of America where the promise of equality has been fully kept. In Buffalo as well as in Birmingham, in Philadelphia as well as in Selma, Americans are struggling for the fruits of freedom. This is one Nation. What happens in Selma or in Cincinnati is a matter of legitimate concern to every American. But let each of us look within our own hearts and our own communities, and let each of us put our shoulder to the wheel to root out injustice wherever it exists. As we meet here in this peaceful, historic chamber tonight, men from the South, some of whom were at Iwo Jima, men from the North who have carried Old Glory to far corners of the world and brought it back without a stain on it, men from the East and from the West, are all fighting together without regard to religion, or color, or region, in Viet-Nam. Men from every region fought for us across the world 20 years ago. And in these common dangers and these common sacrifices the South made its contribution of honor and gallantry no less than any other region of the great Republic--and in some instances, a great many of them, more. And I have not the slightest doubt that good men from everywhere in this country, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, from the Golden Gate to the harbors along the Atlantic, will rally together now in this cause to vindicate the freedom of all Americans. For all of us owe this duty; and I believe that all of us will respond to it. Your President makes that request of every American. PROGRESS THROUGH THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS The real hero of this struggle is the American Negro. His actions and protests, his courage to risk safety and even to risk his life, have awakened the conscience of this Nation. His demonstrations have been designed to call attention to injustice, designed to provoke change, designed to stir reform. He has called upon us to make good the promise of America. And who among us can say that we would have made the same progress were it not for his persistent bravery, and his faith in American democracy. For at the real heart of battle for equality is a deep-seated belief in the democratic process. Equality depends not on the force of arms or tear gas but upon the force of moral right; not on recourse to violence but on respect for law and order. There have been many pressures upon your President and there will be others as the days come and go. But I pledge you tonight that we intend to fight this battle where it should be fought: in the courts, and in the Congress, and in the hearts of men. We must preserve the right of free speech and the right of free assembly. But the right of free speech does not carry with it, as has been said, the right to holler fire in a crowded theater. We must preserve the right to free assembly, but free assembly does not carry with it the right to block public thoroughfares to traffic. We do have a right to protest, and a right to march under conditions that do not infringe the constitutional rights of our neighbors. And I intend to protect all those rights as long as I am permitted to serve in this office. We will guard against violence, knowing it strikes from our hands the very weapons which we seek--progress, obedience to law, and belief in American values. In Selma as elsewhere we seek and pray for peace. We seek order. We seek unity. But we will not accept the peace of stifled rights, or the order imposed by fear, or the unity that stifles protest. For peace cannot be purchased at the cost of liberty. In Selma tonight, as in every--and we had a good day there--as in every city, we are working for just and peaceful settlement. We must all remember that after this speech I am making tonight, after the police and the FBI and the Marshals have all gone, and after you have promptly passed this bill, the people of Selma and the other cities of the Nation must still live and work together. And when the attention of the Nation has gone elsewhere they must try to heal the wounds and to build a new community. This cannot be easily done on a battleground of violence, as the history of the South itself shows. It is in recognition of this that men of both races have shown such an outstandingly impressive responsibility in recent days--last Tuesday, again today, RIGHTS MUST BE OPPORTUNITIES The bill that I am presenting to you will be known as a civil rights bill. But, in a larger sense, most of the program I am recommending is a civil rights program. Its object is to open the city of hope to all people of all races. Because all Americans just must have the right to vote. And we are going to give them that right. All Americans must have the privileges of citizenship regardless of race. And they are going to have those privileges of citizenship regardless of race. But I would like to caution you and remind you that to exercise these privileges takes much more than just legal right. It requires a trained mind and a healthy body. It requires a decent home, and the chance to find a job, and the opportunity to escape from the clutches of poverty. Of course, people cannot contribute to the Nation if they are never taught to read or write, if their bodies are stunted from hunger, if their sickness goes untended, if their life is spent in hopeless poverty just drawing a welfare check. So we want to open the gates to opportunity. But we are also going to give all our people, black and white, the help that they need to walk through those gates. THE PURPOSE OF THIS GOVERNMENT My first job after college was as a teacher in Cotulla, Tex., in a small Mexican-American school. Few of them could speak English, and I couldn't speak much Spanish. My students were poor and they often came to class without breakfast, hungry. They knew even in their youth the pain of prejudice. They never seemed to know why people disliked them. But they knew it was so, because I saw it in their eyes. I often walked home late in the afternoon, after the classes were finished, wishing there was more that I could do. But all I knew was to teach them the little that I knew, hoping that it might help them against the hardships that lay ahead. Somehow you never forget what poverty and hatred can do when you see its scars on the hopeful face of a young child. I never thought then, in 1928, that I would be standing here in 1965. It never even occurred to me in my fondest dreams that I might have the chance to help the sons and daughters of those students and to help people like them all over this country. But now I do have that chanceÉ??and I'll let you in on a secretÉ??I mean to use it. And I hope that you will use it with me. This is the richest and most powerful country which ever occupied the globe. The might of past empires is little compared to ours. But I do not want to be the President who built empires, or sought grandeur, or extended dominion. I want to be the President who educated young children to the wonders of their world. I want to be the President who helped to feed the hungry and to prepare them to be taxpayers instead of taxeaters. I want to be the President who helped the poor to find their own way and who protected the right of every citizen to vote in every election. I want to be the President who helped to end hatred among his fellow men and who promoted love among the people of all races and all regions and all parties. I want to be the President who helped to end war among the brothers of this earth. And so at the request of your beloved Speaker and the Senator from Montana; the majority leader, the Senator from Illinois; the minority leader, Mr. McCulloch, and other Members of both parties, I came here tonight--not as President Roosevelt came down one time in person to veto a bonus bill, not as President Truman came down one time to urge the passage of a railroad bill--but I came down here to ask you to share this task with me and to share it with the people that we both work for. I want this to be the Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, which did all these things for all these people. Beyond this great chamber, out yonder in 50 States, are the people that we serve. Who can tell what deep and unspoken hopes are in their hearts tonight as they sit there and listen. We all can guess, from our own lives, how difficult they often find their own pursuit of happiness, how many problems each little family has. They look most of all to themselves for their futures. But I think that they also look to each of us. Above the pyramid on the great seal of the United States it says--in Latin--""God has favored our undertaking."" God will not favor everything that we do. It is rather our duty to divine His will. But I cannot help believing that He truly understands and that He really favors the undertaking that we begin here tonight. NOTE: The address was broadcast nationally.

Instead of targeting Republican base votersÉ??the ones who show up for every electionÉ??he focused on the intersection of two other groups: people who knew of Donald Trump, and people who had never voted in a primary before. These were both large groups. Because of his TV career and ability to court controversy, Trump was already a household name. Meanwhile, about half AmericaÉ??s potential voters, nearly 100 million people, donÉ??t vote in presidential elections, let alone primaries. The overlap between the groups was significant. If Trump could mobilize even a small percentage of those people, he could clinch the nomination, and Braynard was willing to put in the work. His strategy, built from polls, research, and studies of voting behavior, focused on two goals in particular. The first was registering, engaging, educating, and turning out non-voters, the largest electoral bloc in the country and one thatÉ??s regularly ignored. One recent survey of 12,000 É??chronic non-votersÉ?ù suggests they receive É??little to no attention in national political conversationsÉ?ù and remain É??a mystery to many institutions.É?ù One way to turn out potentially sympathetic voters would be to use a call center to remind them, which would also help with his second goal: to investigate and expose voter fraud. É??If youÉ??re trying to do systematic voter fraud, youÉ??re going to look for people who havenÉ??t or are not going to cast their ballot,É?ù he told me in a recent interview, É??because if you do cast a ballot for them and they do show up at the polling place, thatÉ??s going to set up a red flag.É?ù So the plan was that after the election, the call centers would contact a sample of the people in the state who had voted for the first time to confirm that they had actually cast a ballot. Not only was pursuing voter fraud popular with prospective donors, Braynard says, but it was also an endeavor supported by the academic literature. É??I believe itÉ??s been documented, at least scientifically in some peer-reviewed studies, that at least one senator in the last 10 years was elected by votes that arenÉ??t legal ballots,É?ù he says. This single voter fraud study has become canonical among conservative, and many of todayÉ??s other claims of fraudÉ??such as through mail-in votingÉ??also trace back to it. A study like this does in fact exist, and it and is peer-reviewed. In fact, it goes even further than Braynard remembers. Published in 2014 by Jesse Richman, a political science professor at Old Dominion University, it argues that illegal votes have played a major role in recent political outcomes. In 2008, Richman argued, É??non-citizen votesÉ?ù for Senate candidate Al Franken É??likely gave Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass health care reform.É?ù The paper has become canonical among conservatives. Whenever you hear that 14% of non-citizens are registered to vote, this is where it came from. Many of todayÉ??s other claims of voter fraudÉ??such as through mail-in votingÉ??also trace back to this study. And itÉ??s easy to see why it has taken root on the right: higher turnout in elections generally increases the number of Democratic voters, and so proof of massive voter fraud justifies voting restrictions that disproportionately affect them. Academic research on voting behavior is often narrowly focused and heavily qualified, so RichmanÉ??s claim offered something exceedingly rare: near certainty that fraud was happening at a significant rate. According to his study, at least 38,000 ineligible votersÉ??and perhaps as many as 2.8 millionÉ??cast ballots in the 2008 election, meaning the É??blue waveÉ?ù that put Obama in office and expanded the DemocratsÉ?? control over Congress would have been built on sand. For those who were fed up with margins of error, confidence intervals, and gray areas, RichmanÉ??s numbers were refreshing. They were also very wrong. The data dilemma If you want to study how, whether, and for whom people are going to vote, the first thing you need is voters to ask. Want to reach them by phone? Good luck calling landlines: very few people pick up. You might have a better chance with cell phones, but donÉ??t expect much. Telephone surveys are É??barge inÉ?ù research says Jay H. Leve, the CEO of SurveyUSA, a polling firm based in New Jersey. These phone polls, he says, happen at a time thatÉ??s convenient to the pollster, and É??to hell with the respondent.É?ù For that reason, the company aims to limit calls to four to six minutes, É??before the respondent begins to feel like he or she is being abused.É?ù Online surveys are preferable because respondents can complete them when they want, but itÉ??s still hard to motivate people. For that reason, many survey companies offer something in return for peopleÉ??s opinion, typically points that can be exchanged for gift cards. Even if youÉ??ve found participants, you want to make sure youÉ??re asking good questions, says Stephen Ansolabehere, a government professor at Harvard. He is principal investigator of the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), a national survey of more than 50,000 people about demographics, general political attitudes, and voting intentionsÉ??and the data set used in Jesse RichmanÉ??s voter fraud study. ItÉ??s easy to generate bias in your results by wording your survey questions poorly, says Ansolabehere. Pollsters got it wrong in the 2016 election. Now they want another shot. É??WeÉ??ll try and be literal and give brief descriptions, and we generally donÉ??t do things too adjectivally,É?ù Ansolabehere says. But what about when the bill youÉ??re asking about is called something inflammatory, like the É??Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act?É?ù É??We donÉ??t use that title,É?ù he says. Another problem with opinion polling is that what somebody thinks doesnÉ??t really matter if itÉ??s not going to translate into a vote. That means you have to figure out who will actually show up to the polls. Here, demographic data is helpful. Women vote slightly more than men. White people vote more than people of color. Those 65 and older vote at rates roughly 50% higher than those 18 to 29, and advanced degree holders up to nearly three times as often as those without a high school diploma. However, even if you ladle on the enticements, some demographic groups are simply less likely to respond to survey requests, which means youÉ??ll need to adjust the numbers coming out of your survey group. Most polling firms do this by amplifying the responses they get from underrepresented groups: a survey with a small sample of Hispanic voters, say, might weight their responses more heavily if trying to predict behavior in a battleground state like Arizona, where 24% of voters are Latino. One 2016 presidential poll conducted included a young Black man living in the Midwest who supported Trump. Because he represented several harder-to-reach categoriesÉ??young, minority, maleÉ??his responses were dramatically over-indexed. But beware: this weighting can backfire. One 2016 presidential poll conducted by the University of Southern California and the Los Angeles Times recruited 3,000 respondents from across America, including a young Black man living in the Midwest who turned out to be a Trump supporter. Because he represented several harder-to-reach categoriesÉ??young, minority, maleÉ??his responses were dramatically over-indexed. This ended up throwing the numbers off: at one point the survey estimated TrumpÉ??s support among Black voters at 20%, largely on the basis of this one manÉ??s responses. A post-election analysis put that number at 6%. The media, grasping for certainty, missed the error margins of the study and reached for the headline figures that amplified these overweighted responses. As a result, the survey teamÉ?? which had already made raw data, weighting schemes, and methodology publicÉ??stopped releasing sub-samples of their data to prevent their study being distorted again. Not all researchers are as concerned about potential misinterpretation of their work, however. An academic controversy Until RichmanÉ??s 2014 paper, the virtual consensus among academics was that non-citizen voting didnÉ??t exist on any functional level. Then he and his coauthors examined CCES data and claimed that such voters could actually number several million. Richman asserted that the illegal votes of non-citizens had changed not only the pivotal 60th Senate vote but also the race for the White House. É??It is likely though by no means certain that John McCain would have won North Carolina were it not for the votes for Obama cast by non-citizens,É?ù the paper says. After its publication, Richman then wrote an article for the Washington Post with a similarly provocative headline that focused on the upcoming 2014 midterms: É??Could non-citizens decide the November election?É?ù Unsurprisingly, conservatives ran with this new support for their old narrative and have continued to do so. The studyÉ??s fans include President Trump, who used it to justify the creation of his short-lived and failed commission on voter fraud, and whose claims about illegal voting are now a centerpiece of his campaign. But most other academics saw the study as an example of methodological failure. Ansolabehere, whose CCES data Richman relied on, coauthored a response to RichmanÉ??s work titled É??The Perils of Cherry Picking Low-Frequency Events in Large Sample Sizes.É?ù AP PHOTO/TALLAHASSEE DEMOCRAT, BILL COTTERELL, POOL Stephen Ansolabehere. For starters, he argued, the paper overweighted the non-citizens in the surveyÉ??just as the Black Midwestern voter was overweighted to produce an illusion of widespread Black support for Trump. This was especially problematic in RichmanÉ??s study, wrote Ansolabehere, when you consider the impact that a tiny number of people who were misclassified as non-citizens would have on the data. Some people, said Ansolabehere, had likely misidentified themselves as ineligible to vote in the 2008 study by mistakeÉ??perhaps out of sloppiness, misunderstanding, or just the rush to accumulate points for gift cards. Critically, nobody who had claimed to be a non-citizen in both the 2010 survey and the follow-up in 2012 had cast a validated vote. Nearly 200 social scientists echoed AnsolabehereÉ??s concerns in an open letter, but for Harold Clarke, then editor of the journal that published RichmanÉ??s paper, the blowback was hypocritical. É??If we were to condemn all the papers on voting behavior that have made claims about political participation based on survey data,É?ù he says, É??well, this paper is identical. ThereÉ??s no difference whatsoever.É?ù As it turns out, survey data does contain a lot of errorsÉ??not least because many people who say they voted are lying. In 2012, Ansolabehere and a colleague discovered that huge numbers of Americans were misreporting their voting activity. But it wasnÉ??t the non-citizens,",unknown,"#ifttt, #ifttt network",,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,USA,0,,,,http://shoukhinvlog.tumblr.com/post/633635294923685889,,,ca228b880befa6717db8046d98750d43,,FALSE,,,,,post,0,,290801000,,,0,0,0,,,0,,0,FALSE,2023-03-02T14:47:38.583+0000,,,,shoukhinvlog,,,tumblr,Tumblr,,,FALSE,,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,0,,Tumblr,,,TUMBLR_TEXT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,507014151,,,,,,,,,

Its Dividend Looks Safe. | Barron's (10/29/20, subscription publication) ++++++ Portfolio Management: There continues to be a continuous stream of early corporate bond redemptions. Those early redemptions fall into two general categories. (1) Some issuers are redeeming in the short period just prior to maturity date when they are allowed to do so without having to pay a make whole payment. Usually that period is 1 month prior to maturity, but some issuers have sufficient bargaining power to extend the period to 2 or even 3 months. The bargaining power for a longer period in some instances may go beyond the credit quality issue and include the acceptance of a higher than normal coupon for the credit rating. A recent example is Lockheed Martin's redemption one month early of a 2.5% SU note: (2) The other category involves required make whole payments to exercise the optional redemption rights. A recent example is this 3.7% Corporate Office Properties note that would have matured on 6/15/21, where the issuer had to pay a 2.18% premium to the $1K par value: COPT Announces Expiration of Tender Offer for 3.700% Senior Notes due 2021 and Delivery of Notice of Redemption for Remaining 3.700% Senior Notes due 2021 | Corporate Office Properties Trust Item # 3.A. Bought 2 OFC 3.7% SU Notes Maturing on 6/15/21 (5/10/18 Post) In both categories, the issuer has to pay accrued interest. I received a $25.29 interest payment with the principal payment of $2,043.61 for the two $1k par value bonds. The prospectus for the Corporate Office Properties note would have allowed an early redemption without a make whole payment within two months prior to maturity Pages S11-12 Even though the time to maturity is short, only about 8 months, the make whole payment is juiced by the size of the coupon and the extremely low treasury rate + 25 basis points used to discount the remaining interest due and the principle amount to present value. The low discount rate in effect adds almost all of the remaining interest to the principal amount that has to be paid when exercising the early redemption right. I still own a Corporate Office Property L.P. 3.6% SU maturing on 5/15/23. FINRA Bond Detail (currently rated Baa3/BBB-); Item # 1.E. Bought 2 OFC 3.6% SU bonds maturing in 2023 at a TC of 98.264 (4/23/17 Post)(YTM then at 3.922%) For a new purchaser of that bond, and based on recent transactions, the YTM would be about 1.1%. The problem with the early redemptions is that they are lessening the usefulness of my bond ladder and providing me with even more proceeds that are landing in my broker sweep accounts paying .01% on top of regularly scheduled redemptions, interest and dividend payments. I have managed to stabilize over the past few weeks the cash allocations as percentage of each brokerage accounts total value. That is primarily due to net purchases, a rise in risk asset prices and a slowdown in the total value of bond redemptions from the levels experienced between January and August 2020. Electric Utility Stocks: I like most utility stocks less now than when I started to buy. Valuations are high and yields are relatively paltry. I have started to pare my small ball positions in EVRG, DUK, and PEG, as discussed below. I have not pared PPL which is owned in multiple accounts with unrealized profits in 2 ROTH IRA accounts and 2 taxable accounts and an unrealized loss in my largest position bought first. Part of the paring has to do with comparative dividend yields and partly to valuations after price spurts in EVRG, DUK and PEG. I am unable to generate any excitement in owning those stocks and will not be buying more shares at current prices. DUK is my second largest electric utility position. I am playing small ball with that one, selling near $90 or higher and buying near $80 or lower. I did recently start a position in NJR, a natural gas utility, which I will discuss in a few weeks. New Jersey Resources Corp. (NJR) The NJR yield was somewhat better than the EVRG or PEG. Currently Owned Electric Utility Stocks-All Small Ball Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) Evergy Inc. (EVRG) Exelon Corp. (EXC) PPL Corp. (PPL) Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG) I currently have 1 share Placeholder positions in two electric utility stocks: Southern Company (SO); Consolidated Edison, Inc. (ED) American Electric Power Company (AEP). I sold out of Dominion Energy (D) after the company announced a substantial dividend slash. The consensus E.P.S. estimate for PEG is for $3.4 this year and in 2021. The consensus E.P.S. estimate for EVRG is for $3.2 this year and $3.25 next year. While I am not buying any $1K par value bonds traded in the bond market, I have been nibbling on a few exchange traded bonds and equity preferred stocks ($25 par values). I discuss the purchase of CCNEP, an equity preferred stock in Item # 2 below and adds to the exchange traded bond HTFA in Item # 4 below. More Emphasis on Dividend Income: Interest income is in a dive mode as fixed income securities mature or are redeemed early. Tennessee municipal bond interest payments have eclipsed corporate bond interest payments. The following snapshots are from my Fidelity account: Over the past several months, I have started to rely on new purchases of dividend paying stocks and CEFs for income generation. ++++ Trump: I am slowly plowing through the audio version of Woodward's book ""Rage"", which is Donald's normal state of being. I can only tolerate a few minutes when Woodward is quoting from a tape of an interview.

Donald Trump Wants 'Anonymous' Author Miles Taylor to Be Prosecuted Hopefully, we will know when I publish my next post whether Donald will be given another 4 years as President. It is certainly possible that voters will give this lying, malevolent, ignorant, demagogic malignant narcissist with dominant authoritarian tendencies another 4 years as President. He is obviously unfit to be President. About 78% of white evangelical christians support Donald: White Christians still favor Trump over Biden, but support has slipped | Pew Research Center They admire his honesty and good character. Donald is the kind of decent christian man that their children can aspire to emulate as a role model. And, Donald keeps the bible on his nightstand and reads one of his favorite passages before tweeting. When pressed some will say they approve of the ""conservative"" justices that Trump has appointed, meaning justices that will overrule Roe v. Wade. That justification is no longer going to fly since the Supreme Court already has a relatively youthful reactionary majority, packed with 5 deeply reactionary Justices and one that floats back and forth from reactionary to conservative. Roe v. Wade is toast. If he loses, hopefully Demagogue Don will be totally ignored by a majority of Americans thereafter and will be view as nothing more than a source of brain pollution. I will certainly ignore him but ignoring him will not remove the permanent stain on the U.S. that he has left. Sure, he will make frequent appearances on Fox ""news"" to spread fact free conspiracy theories and thousands of demonstrably false assertions, but his audience will be limited to those who like watching My Pillow commercials.

(CCNE) Prospectus Current Yield at $25.3 = 7.04% Par Value:$25 Dividends: Paid quarterly, non-cumulative and qualified. Dividend Stopper Clause: Yes (see bottom of page S-8 and top of S-9) This clause enforces the preferred shareholder's superior claim to cash compared only to the common shareholder. An elimination of the preferred stock dividend can only occur when the company first eliminates its cash common share dividend and thereafter avoids using cash to buyback its common stock. For a non-cumulative preferred stock, the owners have no right to ever receive the omitted dividend payments. Once the common and preferred share cash dividends are eliminated, the preferred shareholders only right is to start receiving dividends again when and if the company restores any common stock cash dividend. The norm is for bank holding companies to issue non-cumulative preferred stocks, while REITs (equity and MREITs) and many other companies issue cumulative preferred stock.

Moved back to Canada in January of '17. Can't go wrong with an all in one etf for equities in VEQT Vanguard All-Equity ETF Portfolio. I have it through RBC. Probably too heavy in Canadian equities, but it's not like Canadian banks are struggling with all the fees they charge me for both my Canadian and American accounts! Vanguard has balanced ETFs, too but I was looking for 100 percent equities to balance out my other US and Canadian retirement accounts. I love Vanguard for its simplicity. You'll find what you're looking for, and the hardest part will be deciding the ratios you're comfortable with investing. Good luck! Canadian banks are highly leveraged to the housing markets in Toronto and Vancouver. They are structured, with the CMHC, that they won't take the pain of widespread defaults, at least not at first. Non-traditional lenders & CMHC & Genworth (backstopped by the taxpayer) will take that pain. But if you read Hillard Macbeth's book on the housing bubble, and track his twitter, I think there's a persuasive case there that the Canadian banks won't be able to avoid the hit to earnings, and therefore to dividends and share prices, if Greater Vancouver and Greater Toronto go south. In Toronto, at least, that condo market looks very bubblish to me.* On most measures of valuation, personal debt to GDP etc Canada now looks worse than USA 2006 If it is part of a diversified portfolio I agree that it's not the end of the world. And TD Bank and Scotiabank (and BMO via Harris Bank) all have substantial non-Canadian operations. But I do think Canadians need to keep a high level of international diversification. I am totally sold though on the merits of a Vanguard ""one decision fund"" that you just keep buying. The time to buy stocks is when all is doom and gloom, and the time to sell is when all is sunny skies. The opposite of what we do as human beings, mostly. Thus, having the discipline of one fund that you keep contributing to is golden (and as long as it's not more than 30% Canadian equities, I would accept that risk concentration). * check back on this Forum. I have been calling a Toronto housing bubble for at least 5 years, if not nearly 10. Living through the -40% in the early 90s probably scarred me for life. Hah this is a great point! I thought though since the 2008 crash that new guidelines and allocation laws/practices were brought in? Housing prices in Canada, AFAIK, did not crash in 2008. The Minister of Finance at the time (Floyd? the one who died?) loosened CMHC requirements to stimulate the housing market. Housing prices (GVA & GTA at least) dipped for a few months then went straight back up. Toronto currently has more tall construction cranes than any 2 other North American cities combined (including New York, I believe). There was a retightening of CMHC rules subsequently. But if you analyse what's happened, you see prices (GVA and GTA) moving to among the highest price/ income and price/ rent of any big cities in the world. And whereas Americans rebuilt their savings post 2008, Canadians kept right on borrowing - highest private sector debt to GDP in the country's history, and higher than USA in 2006 at peak of its bubble. Maybe Canada won't crash. I know Mark Carney was worried about it when he was governor of Bank of Canada. Maybe mortgage rules were tightened soon enough. But my argument is if you are a Canadian, your currency is driven by 2 (or 3) main factors: - what the US economy is doing. US gets a cold, Canada gets the flu. This was not true in the 2008-10 recession because Canadian consumer kept on spending - what natural resource prices are doing. Particularly oil. Canada's biggest exports (other than autos & parts) are raw materials and the market tends to drive the currency up when natural resource prices are high, and down when they are low (relative to the informal ""base line"" against the USD that the Bank of Canada seems to track). For Australia it is probably iron ore, steam coal; for Canada it is Western Canada Syncrude (plus possibly various wood products) - (now) the state of the Canadian economy, which is about the housing market & consumer spending & business confidence. And more than half of all residential property by value (let alone commercial) is probably in GTA & GVA (I would guess more like 2/3rds). It's easy to sketch out scenarios where fiscal problems (what if Newfoundland goes bust? What's that going to do to Canada's credit rating?) or a housing bubble bust or a prolongued global recession (Chinese demand not driving up raw materials prices) makes Canada's economy very weak. The only remaining tool available to government, then, will be to devalue the dollar (as was done in the 1990s) and rebalance the economy towards exports to the USA (but not of dairy products ). For a Canadian investor, that speaks to global diversification. What you don't want is to get caught in that steamroller if it goes against you. The other main issue is the absence of technology stocks in the Canadian market. Gone are the days when Nortel was 25% of the TSX (and of course that was a horrendous bubble). Canada's index is heavily concentrated in its banks, other financials, natural resources (especially oil sands). Dig out a TSX ETF and see what the top 20 holdings are. From memory, $100k in that ETF is something like $7600 in one bank (Googled it - Royal Bank of Canada). Shopify also looks like a bubble to me. A company whose PE is inflated because it is the only representative Canadian stock in the consumer-internet space. But, then, I remember the days of Nortel and JSDU Uniphase ...

Semiconductor designer AMD said it would buy Xilinx in a $35 billion all-stock deal, intensifying its battle with Intel in the data center chip market. The deal, which AMD expects to close at the end of 2021, would create a combined firm with 13,000 engineers and a completely outsourced manufacturing strategy that relies heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Under the deal, Xilinx shareholders will receive about 1.7 shares of AMD common stock for each share of Xilinx common stock, valuing Xilinx at $143 per share, or about 24.8% higher than its $114.55 closing price on Oct. 26. AMD shareholders will own about 74% of the combined firm, with Xilinx shareholders owning the remaining 26%. The companies said the transaction was intended to be a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. AMD's Lisa Su will lead the combined company as chief executive, with Xilinx's Victor Peng serving as president responsible for the Xilinx business and strategic growth initiatives. The companies expect the deal to generate $300 million in cost savings. AMD also reported earnings earlier than scheduled. It reported revenue and adjusted earnings of $2.80 billion and 41 cents per share, beating Wall Street expectations of $2.57 billion and 36 cents per share. É?õ J M Smucker (SJM) & B&G Foods (BGS). J M Smucker will sell its Crisco business to peer B&G Foods in an all-cash deal valued at about $550 million, as it focuses on pet food, coffee and snacks, the companies said on Monday. J M Smucker, which is looking to exit the U.S. baking category, said the deal also includes its oils and shortening business outside the United States. The company, known for its jelly and beverages, expects the divestiture to cut its annual adjusted earnings per share by 45 cents to 55 cents. Moves É?õ American International Group Inc (AIG). The insurer on Monday said its board approved a plan to separate the life and retirement business from the rest of the company, and named President Peter Zaffino as chief executive officer, effective next year. The insurer said it has yet to make a decision on how to carry out the separation, beyond the board voting to establish two independent, market-leading companies. The separation of the business could take ""a couple of years"" and may be done in phases through sales of minority stakes, according to two people familiar with the matter. The board's decision does not rule out a single sale and any proposed transactions will also need board approval, AIG said. AIG also on Monday said that it incurred an estimated $790 million in catastrophe losses during the third quarter, net of reinsurance and before tax, including $185 million of estimated catastrophe losses for claims related to COVID-19. The losses were broadly in line with what analysts expected. É?õ Tapestry Inc (TPR). The company said its interim chief executive officer Joanne Crevoiserat would take over the role on a permanent basis. Crevoiserat was serving as the company's chief financial officer until July, before replacing Jide Zeitlin who stepped down as CEO amid an investigation into his personal behavior. Crevoiserat is also expected to be appointed to Tapestry's board, the company said. In Other News É?õ Alibaba Group Holding (BABA). Ant Group will close institutional order books of the Hong Kong portion of its record-setting dual IPO ahead of schedule due to strong demand, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. The institutional book of the $17.2 billion Hong Kong listing was due to close on Thursday, but that deadline will be accelerated to Wednesday 5.00 p.m. in each region, three sources said. The book was oversubscribed just one hour after the launch on Monday, two separate sources said. The company, which is an affiliate of Alibaba, is looking to raise up to $34.4 billion in Hong Kong and Shanghai, with the offer split between the two cities, giving it a valuation of about $312 billion. ""The demand is overwhelming ... It will smash all previous records,"" Francis Lun, Hong Kong-based chief executive of GEO Securities, said about retail demand for Ant. É?õ Alphabet Inc (GOOGL). U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta on Monday set a status hearing on the Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit against Google for Friday. The Justice Department last week sued the $1 trillion company and accused it of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals in the biggest challenge to the power and influence of Big Tech in decades. Mehta said lawyers for Google and the Justice Department must appear at the telephone status hearing at 10 a.m. EDT that will be open to the public or media. É?õ AstraZeneca PLC (AZN). South Korea's food and drug ministry said it had begun a preliminary review of a COVID-19 vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca for potential fast-track approval. The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said in a statement that it had formed a screening team to review the vaccine candidate, with an application for formal approval expected in 90 days under its rapid approval programme for COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. The team is reviewing the vaccine's non-clinical test data, the ministry said. É?õ Boeing Co (BA). The U.S. State Department has approved the potential sale of 100 Boeing-made Harpoon Coastal Defense Systems to Taiwan in a deal that has a potential value of up to $2.37 billion, the Pentagon said on Monday. ""We deplore BeijingÉ??s efforts to retaliate against U.S. and foreign companies for their sales that support TaiwanÉ??s legitimate self-defense requirements,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement. Monday's formal notifications to Congress by the State Department covered the proposed sale of up to 100 Harpoon Coastal Defense Systems (HCDS), which includes 400 RGM-84L-4 Harpoon Block II Surface Launched Missiles to serve as coastal defense cruise missiles. É?õ Charles Schwab Corp (SCHW). The company said on Monday it is laying off about 1,000 positions in the combined workforce of Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade to streamline and reshape their branch network. ""These reductions are part of our efforts to reduce overlapping or redundant roles across the two firms,"" Charles Schwab, which completed the acquisition of TD Ameritrade earlier in October, said. The financial services company also said it won't be executing any additional company-wide reductions for the rest of 2020. ""Employees whose roles are impacted by today's changes will have early access to all newly opened positions and be treated as internal candidates for the more than 1,000 currently open positions at Schwab through their 60-day notice period"", the company said on Monday. É?õ Citigroup Inc (C). Ireland's permanent tsb (PTSB) announced the sale of a portfolio of 3,700 buy-to-let mortgage accounts for a consideration of 1.2 billion euros to a subsidiary of U.S. bank Citibank. The sale of the loans, which are predominately on interest-only repayment terms, are classified as performing and have an average remaining term of 10 years, PTSB said in a statement. Citibank, which is making the purchase via Citibank NA London, intends to syndicate the portfolio via securitisation following completion of the acquisition, the PTSB statement said.

The new company is expected to trade its ordinary shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""GENI"", upon closing of the deal, the company said. É?õ Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS). The bank attempted to cover up allegations of workplace sexual misconduct by the company's global head of litigation, a lawsuit filed on Monday in New York State Supreme Court claimed. The lawsuit was filed by Marla Crawford, a former associate general counsel at the bank, against Goldman Sachs, the bank's General Counsel Karen Seymour and its Global Head of Litigation, Darrell Cafasso. The lawsuit claimed Cafasso used his position of power to ""romantically prey upon a much younger and vulnerable female colleague."" Crawford, who was a confidant of the alleged victim, attempted to speak up about the alleged misconduct, the lawsuit said, and was subsequently fired after 10 years of ""exemplary performance."" É?õ Las Vegas Sands Corp (LVS). The casino operator is exploring a sale of its flagship casinos in Las Vegas for about $6 billion, a source told Reuters on Monday, with the move likely to mark the exit of the group's chairman from the U.S. gambling industry for now. The properties included in the potential sale are Sands Expo Convention Center, the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Palazzo, the source added, asking not to be identified. Bloomberg reported earlier that Las Vegas Sands is working with an adviser to solicit interest from potential suitors, with a company representative cited by the news outlet confirming there were early discussions about a sale and that nothing has been finalised. É?õ Tiffany & Co (TIF). The jeweler has received all regulatory approvals needed for the completion of its $16 billion acquisition by French luxury goods group LVMH, Tiffany said on Monday after it received a nod from the European Commission. The approval from the European competition authorities comes amid a legal battle between LVMH and Tiffany, with the latter suing the Louis Vuitton owner in a Delaware court, alleging that the French company has deliberately been stalling the completion of the deal. É?õ Twitter Inc (TWTR). The social media company on Monday flagged a tweet by U.S. President Donald Trump about mail-in ballots, adding a disclaimer describing the post's content as ""disputed"" and potentially misleading. ""Big problems and discrepancies with Mail In Ballots all over the USA. Must have final total on November 3rd"", Trump tweeted late on Monday, with the tweet giving no evidence for his assertion. ""Some or all of the content shared in this Tweet is disputed and might be misleading about how to participate in an election or another civic process"", Twitter's disclaimer said. The disclaimer included a link to a page highlighting how mail voting was legal and safe.

Canada - Britain, France - mid 16th century to Confederation (1867) or the Canada Act (1982). After the Canada Act, all the constitutional control was turned over to Canada by the UK. 2. USA - Britain, France, Spain, Dutch, Germany - mid 16th century to American Independence (1776). Russians had colonized the Alaska region until the US purchased it. South America: 1. Brazil - Portuguese - roughly 300 years from 1500 to 1815. The Dutch and French also asserted their rule in Brazil for short periods. 2. Argentina - Spain - 16th century to Argentine Independence (1816). All the countries were colonized at some point in time by most of the European countries (UK, France, Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, É??) American continent ( north) was colonized by all- USA was colonized by Italy/ German/ French/ English. Mexico, entire central America, entire South America [ except Brazil , Guyana] were colonized by Spain. Brazil was Portuguese colony, Guyana was colonized by England, France and Dutch! The Caribbean islands were colonized by England/ Spain/ Dutch. Africa All the countries were colonized at some point in time by most of the European countries (UK, France, Belgium, Germany, É??) Ethiopia was technically an Italian colony between 1936 and 1941, when they were delivered by the British and recovered their monarchy. So, they are in the colony list, even if it was only 5 years. All of Africa except Ethiopia and Liberia was colonized by every European colonial power possible. 50 + nations in Africa- colonized by Portuguese/ Germany/ France/ England/ Holland/ Spain/ even by Italy for short time. ( South Africa was initially a Dutch colony). Oceania All the countries were colonized at some point in time by most of the European countries (do you start to see a pattern? J ) except one: Tonga Tonga was the only Pacific nation to retain its monarchical government (still in place). They became a British protectorate in 1900 but remained sovereign. Asia Almost all the countries were colonized by European, countries or japan or China, except 5 countries: China, only partially occupied by Japan during WWII and forced to sign É??unequal treatyÉ?ù in favor of the European during the Qing dynasty Japan, only briefly occupied by the USA after WWII Bhutan, they lost two war against Britain and had to give some territories but remained independent Nepal, they also lost a war against Britain but became after a strong ally of Britain and remained independent Thailand, the only south-Asian country to remain independent thanks to good leaders that used the rivalry between French and British to be accepted as a buffer state between both colonial power (in the process, they also lost lot of territories) 1. India - Britain, Portuguese, Dutch, French - 17th century to Indian Independence (1947). The French, the Portuguese and the Dutch held islands and major ports in the Indian subcontinent. The Portuguese left India in 1961. 2. Korea - Japan - Around 1910 to 1945. 3. Hong Kong - Britain - 1842 to 1997. Except for Japanese occupation from 1941 to 1945. 4. Burma (Myanmar) - Britain - 1824 to 1948. Whole Asia - with couple of exception- was colonized. India ( no Pakistan at that time nor Bangla Desh), Ceylon, Malaya, Singapore, Maldives etc. Kuwait/ UAE etc were protectorates. Giant Indonesia was under Dutch, Philippines was under Spain/ USA/ Japan. Vietnam/ Laos/ Cambodia were under France. Middle-east Again, except three countries (Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey), they were all colonized by European/Ottoman: Iran. The country was invaded by Britain and the soviet during WWII. The Shah was neutral but pro-axis. The problem is that with Barbarossa, the trans-Iranian railways was vital to send resources to the soviets (for the lend-lease) . Therefore, Britain and the Soviet Union invaded Iran in 1941, put a new pro-ally Shah and kept control of the country until 1946. However, the country was just occupied and not a colony per se. Saudi Arabia. Nobody even bothered to colonize these deserts. And when the petrol was found in 1938, colonization was not trendy anymore -T urkey 1. Egypt - Britain - 1882 to 1914. 2. Algeria - France - 1830 to 1962 3. Palestine - UK - 1920 to 1948 Now mostly Israel, Palestine was more of a British occupation than a colony. Europe Here, itÉ??s sometimes a bit tricky, e.g. if you go back in time the south of Italy was a Greek colony, so Italy should be a colonized country É?? However, at these time the concept of country was really different, so I will only take into account modern history, when the state-nation appeared, i.e. when the concept of nation that we use appeared, so after the French revolution. I also consider a country as a colony if there is a will to É??replaceÉ?ù the population. E.g. Lithuania was a Russian colony as Russia wanted to implant lot of Russian there. On the other hand, Belgium was not a Dutch colony, as the Dutch only wanted to annex the country. Then almost all the countries of western Europe were not colony (but most of them where conquered at some point), except Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland and Finland: Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. The three Baltic states were Russian colony, with a forced implantation of Russian people. Finland is a more dubious case. It was also a Russian colony, although they were relatively free, so they could be considered more as a protectorate. Poland, it was split between Russia, Austria and Germany and all of them wanted to implant people there. However, some other countries could be considered as colony of other. I personally donÉ??t as in these cases, there was no will to replace the population and harvest all the resources. It was more a É??usual occupationÉ?ù, were one country annex the other. A good example is Belgium that was occupied by the Spanish, Austrian, French and Dutch over times but they were each time considered as part of the country and not a colony. There was no will to replace the Belgian by Spanish people or to send back all the resources to Austria. There was also a will to invest there. However, other people may disagree with me. Amongst these countries, we have: Ukraine. Again, it was conquered by Russian but I donÉ??t know if we can consider it as a colony. The Russian only wanted to annex the É??white RussianÉ?ù Balkan states + Greek, itÉ??s a total mess between the Austria and Ottoman occupation and the war between the Balkan countries. However, I donÉ??t think that they fall under the colony status. The former states of the Austrian empire. Again, was the Czech Republic an Austrian colony. I donÉ??t think so, but other may have another point of view Greenland, Faeroe Island, and all the island under the control of Denmark, Norway, É?? Again are they protectorate or colony, is mater at discussion. South Pacific: 1. Australia - Britain, Dutch - 18th century to 1901. 2. New Zealand - Britain - 1847 to self-governing (1853) or dominion (1907). Australia/ NZ/ Fiji were under UK ( even now). Pacific islands were under England/ France/ USA ( even now Samoa is under USA). - Alaska, Angola, Australia, Barbados, Brazil, Canada, Congo, Ghana, Greenland, Guinea-Bissau, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Liberia, South Africa, Macau, Malta, Mozambique, Philippines, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, United States of America. Which countries/regions are colonized even today Instead of É??coloniesÉ??, these are more like autonomous territories without sovereignty Under Denmark: Faroe Islands, Greenland Under Finland: Aland Islands Under France: Saint Barthelemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Wallis and Futuna, French Polynesia, New Caledonia, Clipperton Island, French Southern and Antarctic Lands (consists: Reunion, Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, Mayotte) Under Netherlands: Aruba, Curacao, Sint Maarten Under Norway: Svalbard, Jan Mayen. There are some under USA and UK as well, but I canÉ??t seem to find a proper list of them, so IÉ??ll update the answer with them later. Palestine deserves a special mention for being colonised and under occupation by the British from 1920, and 1948 to present by Jewish settlers. While other nations allow the colonized population equal/voting rights to vote, Israel doesnÉ??t have the population to support such an approach and, therefore, prolongs the occupation/apartheid indefinitely to ensure Jewish majority in government in apartheid democracy.",male,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,,0,,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLqZVtxRqiMlc=Ugz7LlRE0smpXAPFHTF4AaABAg&lc=Ugz7LlRE0smpXAPFHTF4AaABAg,,,f03e2eef942e9e0adeac0ca958ef1df8,,FALSE,,,,,reply,0,,1.00E+11,,,0,0,0,,,0,,0,FALSE,2023-03-02T14:47:23.637+0000,,,,,,,youtube,YouTube,,,FALSE,,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,0,,YouTube,,,VCOMMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Vlad Igor,,,,,,,,,
